# CNN Checkers

# This is a checkers engine driven by a trained convolutional neural network that comes with a simple UI that can be run from a shell. 

Dependencies:
1. Python 2.7.11 (https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-2711/)
2. Numpy library (from terminal: pip install numpy)
3. Pandas library (from terminal: pip install pandas)
4. Tensorflow library (from terminal: pip install tensorflow)

Instructions:
1. From your shell, cd to this directory
2. Run checkers.py by entering ’python checkers.py’
3. A set of game-play instructions will appear
4. Press enter to start playing.

Notes:
Because this program does not yet have a gui, I suggest that you run a separate checkers game in parallel (in two-player mode) for a better experience.
